<p>Hey, this is my first design work. hmmmm, it’s a kinda simple calendar app icon.</p>

<p>I have been interested in design for a long time. But just dont have enough time to learn how. So this week I have one free afternoon time to try some design work.</p>

<p>The tools I use is Sketch 3.0 trial version. hmmm, it’s a powerful tools, much easier than Photoshop, maybe the only thing I need is a better mouse haha.</p>

<p>During the process, I think the most difficult part should be how to think about a good idea. Thats what a good design needed. At first, I think maybe calendar icon should be easy, cause most of this kind icons looks similar. However, after finish the main framework, it’s very ugly, and there should be something to make it special.</p>

<p>So I turned to Dribbble to find some ideas, then I made one pretty similar as Fantastical icon, that icon looks pretty good. At the end, I thought this is my first time do design work, why not make a self-design one, so after long time thinking, I decided to make this label icon one.</p>

<p>Design is complex work, which you should put lots of time on details and design ideas.</p>

<p>It’s 19th May now, for I just enjoyed my birthday at 18th May :)</p>

<p>Today, the coding work starts officially, however, some coding work with Theano has already begun.</p>

<p>In the community bonding phrase, I met with theano-dev community people, and have communicated with my mentor, luckily, one of my mentor James said he would travel to China at June or July, so maybe we can have a meeting offline. Also, I have really really do appreciate Frédéric for his patience and help. During this time, I think I have known more about Theano.</p>

<p>On the hand, I also joined the Chinese community bonding, we made a Chinese students group, and we chat with each others very often. Sharing our different project, very useful tools, how to let more Chinese students know about GSoC; helping others solving code problems, or sometimes jokes.</p>

<p>Till now I have finished some code to modify the memory output of Theano profile,   but there seems to be some errors with Travis CI, I will try to fix it out asap.</p>

<p>Keep Coding, Roy!</p>

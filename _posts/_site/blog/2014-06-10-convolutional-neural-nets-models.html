<p><strong>Mainly summarize the publicly avaiable CNN models</strong></p>

<p>(主要整理了一下一些平常可以用到CNN成熟架构和模型)</p>

<p>First of all: GPU calculating, mainly for Cuda(NVIDIA) to accelerate the training phrase.</p>

<p><strong>1. Theano (deeplearning.net/tutorials)</strong></p>

<p>based on Python</p>

<p>link: <a href="http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/">http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/</a></p>

<p>The tutorials presented here will introduce you to some of the most important deep learning algorithms and will also show you how to run them using Theano. Theano is a python library that makes writing deep learning models easy, and gives the option of training them on a GPU.</p>

<p><strong>2. caffe (Convolutional Architecture for Fast Feature Extraction)</strong></p>

<p>based on C++, with Python/Matlab wrapper</p>

<p>link:<a href="https://github.com/BVLC/caffe">https://github.com/BVLC/caffe</a></p>

<p>Created by Yangqing Jia, UC Berkeley EECS department. In active development by the Berkeley Vision and Learning Center (BVLC).</p>

<p><strong>3. decaff</strong></p>

<p>based on Python</p>

<p>link: <a href="https://github.com/UCB-ICSI-Vision-Group/decaf-release">https://github.com/UCB-ICSI-Vision-Group/decaf-release</a></p>

<p>Decaf is a framework that implements convolutional neural networks, with the goal of being efficient and flexible. It allows one to easily construct a network in the form of an arbitrary Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and to perform end-to-end training.</p>

<p><strong>4. deepnet</strong></p>

<p>based on Python</p>

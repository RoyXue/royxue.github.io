<p><strong>Theano Update Log #2226</strong></p>

<p>This week I mainly implement a new faster algorithm for counting the min peak.</p>

<p>When the node number increase, the recursive way also increases a lot, even we have already done the executable_set part. So what we need to do is to find a more efficient way to reduce the back track times.</p>

<p>This week what we do is using DONE_SET. DONE_SET: a set store executed nodes DONE_DICT: store the DONE_SET and its memory usage</p>

<p>The mainly idea is that when we execute a node, we add it to the DONE_SET, then we check if the DONE_SET is in the DONE_DICT or not. Attentions: here the set obejct is not hashable, we cannot use it as dictâ€™s key, so we use frozenset() to transfer the set to frozenset as the frozenset is hashable and can be used as a key.</p>

<p>If not in DONE_DICT, update the DONE_DICT. If yes, continue to check if the previous DONE_SET memory usage is bigger than the current memory usage. True, then we update the memory usage in DONE_DICT to current memory usage. False, remove the node from DONE_SET and stop this iteration, move to next node in executable_node.</p>

<p>The algo is definitely faster, but now there remains another question, I ran the logistic_cg for several times, and I got different results. This means that during the computing process we miss some possibility and the real min peak.</p>

<p>The next step is to think about how to get the accurate result.</p>

<h1 id="update-in-1st-nov">Update in 1st Nov.</h1>

<p>Previous problem solved. By using the max_mem_count to take place of mem_count.</p>

<p>Also using a better if in new version, clean up duplicated code, make it more beautiful :)</p>

<p>It seems like the last time I write C language is in the Summer after Grade 1, for the class final project. It’s really a long time that I almost forget all the stuff I learnt.</p>

<p>Well, I choose a new class, Software Security, it’s mainly based on C, so I think maybe it will be great chance for me to recall the memory of C. Aha</p>

<p>This time I will mainly use vim + gcc to finish the whole class and projects.</p>

<p>Aha. Go!</p>

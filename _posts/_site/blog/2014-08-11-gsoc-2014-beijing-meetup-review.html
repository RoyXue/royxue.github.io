<p>For the first main section: there are 10 students shared their GSoC projects:
1.Roy — Theano
2.Allen — Joomla
3.Santo — Gcc
4.Jxir — Cern
5.Sun — Xapian
6.Xudifsd — Clojure
7.Aaren — Wikipedia</p>

<p>This is the 10th year of GSoC, but it’s the first time for Chinese students having a meetup. I’d like to regard this as a perfect begining step of GSoC in China. By this chances, we met not only Chinese students who are doing GSoC but also those who are interested in open source projects. We sat together, sharing the GSoC experience(our projects, our mentor and our dev tools), also we held a discussion about how to promote GSoC and open source in China. Because now in China, many students dont know projects like GSoC and open source project, we wanna change the situation and let more Chinese students join in the open source projects, I think that’s the original aim of GSoC not only just let students do part of work but also give them chances to know, to learn, to become a member of open source communities.</p>

<p>By sharing, we know each others’ GSoC projects and how they do their work, still, this is a great chance for “advertisement”, make more people know our open source community. By dicussion, we talked about how we know about GSoC and how can we promote, it seems like lots of people know it by Aaren’s post on zhihu.com(Chinese version Quora). Also, we will do some promotion in our universities.</p>

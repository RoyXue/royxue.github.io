<hr />

<p>This is the 4th week class of Algorithmic Thinking. Actually I had my plan to learn to learn DP before, and I almost forgot the coursera class this week, because of some other heavy burden.</p>

<p>The basic part of making sense of Dynamic Programming is to distinguish it from Recursive Algorithm.</p>

<p>As we can see, using Recursive Algorithm is like when we solving a big problem, we divide it into some sub-problem, then we solve the sub-problem, over and over and over again. In Dynamic Programming, we store the value into a table, then when we are solving sub-problem, get value in the table instead of run the function again.</p>

<p>The solving process is like using more space to get less runtime. Like when we wanna solve a specific problem, we just save the value when we first time run at that place, then store the value into some data structure. Then when next time we run at this place we can just use the stored value instead of computing it. The stored value can regarded as <strong>status</strong>.</p>

<p>For example, there is a question whats the min number of coins($1, $3, $5) needed for an 11 dollars ice cream. Letâ€™s make a formula first: f(i)=j, means to combime j dollars at least we need how many coins. What we do is like start from 0. For $0, clearly we need 0 coins. Then we move to f(1), here we need 1 $1 coin, and then f(2), f(2)+1=2. Next when we move to 3, there would be 2 solution like f(3-1)+1=3 or f(3-3)+1=1. Clearly at this step what we need is Min{f(3-1)+1, f(3-3)+1}. As this process goes on:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;code&gt;f(0) = 0
f(1) = 1
f(2) = 2    :f(2-1)+1
f(3) = 1    :f(3-3)+1
f(4) = 2    :f(4-3)+1
f(5) = 5    :f(5-5)+1
f(6) = 2    :f(6-5)+1
f(7) = 3    :f(7-6)+1
f(8) = 2    :f(8-5)+1
f(9) = 3    :f(9-8)+1
f(10) = 1   :f(10-5)+1
f(11) = 1   :f(11-10)+1
&lt;/code&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Then we can easily get the answer. This is only a simple question. For some more information about this. Click the following link.</p>

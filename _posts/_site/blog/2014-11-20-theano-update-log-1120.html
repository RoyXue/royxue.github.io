<p>The if/else crash in memory profiler is fixed.</p>

<p>Another part is add CPU/GPU memory usage calculating support. In previous version, the memory usage is only sum value, in order to make more information avaiable, so we add CPU/GPU separate memory usage information support. This part is quite simple, when we are calculating each variable, check its type first, if it is CudaNdarray or not.</p>

<p>Also, for the memory usage information, the CPU and GPU will share a list like [CPU, GPU], choosing this way to store the value is to make it flexible when we implement multi GPU later.</p>

<p><strong>Theano Update Log 1018</strong></p>

<p>Recently this time, Arnaud is working to make Theano able to use multiple GPUs in 1 Theano function.</p>

<p>The main task I did is implement a theano_funtion.free() method to free the temp memory</p>

<p>During this part, the most time consuming part is to know the internals, how a theano function works, and how the variables changes.</p>

<p>The main idea is simple. Check when allow_gc is False, loop over the storage_map set the value of TensorVariable to None. On this step, the storage_map is a dict, the keys are node, value are list of 1 element, what we do is to set this element to None.</p>

<p>Then there for the node in apply_nodes, there would be some node whose op has inner functions, we also need to run free() on there inner functions.</p>

<p>Thanks to Fred, we found the problem that CVM now has now attribute “allow_gc”, and he fixed this. Now we can set allow_gc in CVM.</p>

<p>For the test file, the theano uses nosetests, nosetests is really a good test tools. You can easily choose only run one test a time, using “nosetests file:module.function” to specific one test function.</p>

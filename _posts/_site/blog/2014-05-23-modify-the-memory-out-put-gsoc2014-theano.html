<p>My first part of tasks is to modify the profile_memory of Theano. It’s almost done. The PR link is <a href="https://github.com/Theano/Theano/pull/1854">https://github.com/Theano/Theano/pull/1854</a>.</p>

<p>These tasks are mainly about memory usage tracking with node and graph in Theano. Graph is a Theano build-in structrue composed of interconnected variable nodes, op nodes and apply nodes (<a href="http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/tutorial/symbolic_graphs.html">Graph Stuctrue</a>).</p>

<p>My first step is to create a list to store node executed order which is different from the old order Theano used before. Also, on the same time, I should create another list which store the node cleared order. These modification are mainly in theano/gof/vm.py class Stack, call method, it means each time it call this class generate these 2 list. The data stuctrue here is that storage_map is a dict of variables(node), variables is a kind of node which contains type, owner, index, name. So, in the 2 list we just store the variables once they got executed or cleared. Then if we want to modify the output there remains a question: how can I call these two list in the profiling.py?</p>

<p>The other .py I will work with is theano/compile/profiling.py. The first task is to know how I call the 2 list, they are stored in fgraph.profile. Also, the memory track algorithm we used now is</p>

<pre><code>&lt;code&gt;current_mem_usage=0
for node in order:
    for var_mem for node_mem[node]:
        if var_mem is a view or inplace:
            continue
            current_mem_usage += var_mem
# After the node execute, we delete intermediate results that aren’t              # needed anymore:
    for old_s in old_storage_for_this_node: (this from the second list.)
        current_mem_usage -= old_s
&lt;/code&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>for the 2 set of node orders, theano has to do the loops 2 times. So I create a function with this algorithm and call it twice to calcluate the max values. During one of this test, the Travis CI occurs an error, I thought is there some error in my code but finally after Fred restart Travis CI, the code got passed, so maybe it’s Travis CI has some little bugs. After finished big part of task, I pay my attention on other details like add code comments, fix some little bugs. Now, I am waiting my mentor’s code review.</p>

<p>People always say the first step is important, because this is where we go for 1 from 0, doing there tasks not only make me know more about theano, but also make me realize there are still lots of things that I dont know about Theano.</p>

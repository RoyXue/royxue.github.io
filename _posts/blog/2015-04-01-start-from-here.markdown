The title is just a little bit weired, where is here? 

Thanks to Kakazu San give my this oppotunity to do my own project in one month. This Monday, I shared my ideas in company meeting, and finally decide what to do in the following one month.

The moment I decided the idea make me remind of 4 months ago in the Hackathon. Team always make things easier, but this time I can only do it by myself, which means building back end, front end, and design.

But it's a good chance to try something cool!

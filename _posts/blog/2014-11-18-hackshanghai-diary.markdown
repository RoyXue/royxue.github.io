Just wake up from a more than 10 hours sleeping.





**Shanghai**





I remember last time I went to Shanghai is when I graduated from high school. Now, Shanghai really changed a lot, and comparing to Guangzhou, is much more beautiful and clean, which makes Guanzhou looks like sub city area.





Aha, I also met some of my old friends in Shanghai. For one, I havent seen her for almost 6 or 7 years, however, it just feels like old days came back, we didnt change too much, but we are not who we were. That's how time goes by, I guess.





**NYU&Staffs**





Thanks to the organization team and sponsors. I enjoyed myself during the HackShanghai, it would be great memory in my life.





The campus of NYU Shanghai is really beautiful and modern, I like it more than my SCUT campus haha, also during the whole hackathon the staffs provide snacks and drink to gain energy, I think I just ate too much during the 24 hours, haha.





**HooCal**





This is our project name, **"HooCal"**, which combines the "Hook" and "Calendar". It is a Massively Multiplayer Role Playing Calendar, (aha, just kidding). Actually it is a calendar-based SNS driven by events.





It has features as following:






    
  * Users can create public events and then share it via QRcode and email.

    
  * Users can subscribe some specific events/users via searching some tags/themes.

    
  * Users with the same interests can form an organization which they can work together to create/edit specifc events.

    
  * By using Moxtra SDK, the system will automatically create a real-time chat room for each events, users who subscribe this event can talk/share files/add to-do tasks of this events.

    
  * Companies can own their official accounts to create events with higher quality and accuracy. Also, this is the bussiness pattern we wanna do.

    
  * For future vision, with sufficient amount users we can play some machine learning/data mining algo, build a recommodation system.





Though HooCal has some similarity with Google Calendar or something else, but what we wanna make is not just a tool, but a social network, a community. Also, now in China, only a few people have habits of using calendar, what we wanna do is users can grow a habit of using calendar in daily life by our product.





**Results**





We won the Moxtra prize, which is for the best team using Moxtra SDK, and we got some pebble watches, and 6 months mentorship from Moxtra CTO Stanley Huang, I think it would be a great chance to learning something. On the other hand, Moxtra SDK is really convenient if you wanna build a system with real-time interacting like meeting or anything else, that's why we choose to use it in our projects.





For other results, some participates are not satisfied with them. Like one guy said hangry(hungry plus angry), using hardware has more advantages than pure software. Even a simple CNN based product is rewarded, which can be built in half an hour if you know deep learning. However, we are not judges, right? The judges are managers in sponsor company, so maybe they have been away from the frontier of Tech for a long time.





**SNH48**





I should have write something about this, haha.





However I dont know how to describe it. To be honest I dont like the XXX Chinese Songs. I prefer the original Japanese songs more. Whatever, the SNH48 show is really interesting. Maybe I will go there next time when I go to Shanghai.



And I met a girl :)

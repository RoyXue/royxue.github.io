Now it's my third week in Japan. Life is just too busy to catch up all stuffs, like writing this blog :)

Whatever, I love this city, this country. Always I feel like that I am like a new delivered baby, so eager to see, to experience the this new world.

I learnt Rails in previous 2 weeks, finished some web development tasks by Rails. I guess the actual time spending on learning Rails maybe less than one week? Im just not sure about it. But, Python and Ruby, Django and Rails are pretty similar except the grammar difference. The previous Django and Python knowledge helped me a lot on Ruby. Ruby is kind of language you can write like a poem, which means one beautiful line to do something powerful, hmmm, this is what I wanna learn more in the future.

I guest the most important things on my wish list have been finished, saw kojiharu in the real life is the best moment in Japan till now. It's a little bit difficult to describe the feeling at that moment. doki doki doki doki. haha.

Next week, I will start my own project, although till now I have no idea about what to do. Im looking forward to the first step, because there are lots of things to learn, to try, to enjoy!~~~

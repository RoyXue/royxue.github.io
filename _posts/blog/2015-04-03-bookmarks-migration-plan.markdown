I have been using Chrome bookmarks for a long time, the folder stucture gradually become deep and messy, so I think it's time to change!

At first, what I wanna do is to find a designed Mac OS app to manage all bookmarks offline, but unfortuantely I didnt find satisfied one, good design and reasonable price app is hard to find, whatever if you dont mind price, [fetching](fetching.io) is a good one. [RainDrop](raindrop.io) is also good, but hmmm... it's just too many bugs inside this Beta version, even I cannot import my bookmarks, but as it will getting better, so I would use it when it can work well in the future.

Then I turned to online bookmarks service, honestly pinboard is the best choice, but after it's change to per-year price, it would be a little hard to accept that. Finally, I decide to use [Delicious](https://delicious.com). It's free but some ads there. 

Also, a good app is needed for better experience, I use Shiori now, it's light but beatiful, u can set the hot key to easily store and open the bookmarks.(like another Alfred, haha)

Hmmmm, I think maybe Im not going to import Chrome bookmarks into Delicous, but use Delicious as new service for storing bookmarks, Chrome bookmarks only for those website I always use in daily life.
